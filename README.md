### Image Signal Processing Assignments
- This repo hosts my solutions to the course assignments.
- I explored several interesting facets of image processing through the assignments as follows:
1. Image Transformations - rotation, translation, and scaling
2. Occlusion Detection - homography
3. Mosaicing
4. Space-Variant Blurring
5. Space-Invariant Blurring
6. Shape from Focus
7. Fourier Transform / DFT
8. Otsu Thresholding
9. K-Means Clustering
